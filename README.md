# Entertainment App - OTT

This project aims to create a full OTT-style platform where users can browse and explore their favorite content.

It uses the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/) to populate the catalog. Of course, the platform does not host or stream any copyrighted material â€” it only displays trailers via YouTube.

The design is based on the [Entertainment Web App challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/entertainment-web-app-J-UhgAW1X), although the entire development has been built from scratch.
